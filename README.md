The project, part of the [Udacity's Deep Learning program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), consists of building a neural network from scratch to predict daily bike rental ridership. The dataset contains the number of rentals for each hour between 01/01/2011 and 31/12/2012, along with contextual information such as temperature, humidity and wind speed. Throughout the project the goal is to:
* Pre-process the data
  * Convert categorical variables into dummy variables
  * Standardise variables such that they have zero mean and standard deviation of 1
* Build the neural network
  * Code both the forward pass and backward pass
  * Set appropriate hyperparameters â€” learning rate, number of hidden units, number of EPOCHS.
* Train the network with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Evaluate the model using mean squared error (MSE) on the training, validation and testing data.

The following image show the predictions for the month of December. Note the drawback of the model that fails to capture the seasonal effect related to Christmas and end-of-year holidays. A possible approach to address this problem is to extend upon the data pre-processing step, adding feature engineering that considers the [partial autocorrelation (PACF)](https://youtu.be/DeORzP0go5I).

## Network architecture
The network is composed of a hidden layer and an output layer. The former uses the sigmoid activation function whereas the latter has only one node used for the regression. Thus, the output layer returns its input (i.e., $f(x) = x$). The following figure illustrates the network architecture.
